Short, iPython demonstrations of simple concepts (originally for use in teaching ENG 1/2/3)

Note that these notebooks were developed to be presented, and are therefore limited in the level of detail in the accompanying text.

Also, some of the notebooks will be made to be presented using RISE, which can be installed very easily from here: https://github.com/damianavila/RISE
